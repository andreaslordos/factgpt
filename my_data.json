Forbes estimates his net worth at $1.5 million in 2024.

            "summary": "The claim that women in America are being treated worse than women in Afghanistan lacks important context and misrepresents the situation in both countries. In Afghanistan, since the Taliban takeover in August 2021, women and girls face severe restrictions on their rights, including bans on education beyond the sixth grade and on working outside specific sectors. The UN and other international bodies have documented these restrictions and their impact on Afghan women's freedom and well-being (https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2021/12/gender-alert-womens-rights-in-afghanistan, https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/03/afghanistan-un-experts-say-20-years-progress-women-and-girls-rights-erased, https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/feature-story/2023/08/women-in-afghanistan-from-almost-everywhere-to-almost-nowhere, https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/03/1134352). . While the United States has made progress towards gender equality, significant challenges remain, with a majority of Americans believing more efforts are needed to achieve gender equality (https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/07/07/a-century-after-women-gained-the-right-to-vote-majority-of-americans-see-work-to-do-on-gender-equality/). However, comparing the two directly overlooks the critical differences in the nature and extent of restrictions on women's rights and freedoms in each context."
